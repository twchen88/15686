% [data] = settle_hopfield_net(w, data, iters) settles a hopfield network
%  with initial configurations data, weight matrix w, and the number of

%  
% INPUTS:
%   w ............. : an (v by v) weight matrix where v is the number of
%                       visible units
%   data .......... : an (n by v) data matrix where n is the number of

%   iters ......... : number of iterations to run the settling algorithm

% OUTPUTS:
%   data .......... : an (n by v) matrix which is the network
